"""Postcondition check for the release artifacts embedded in a build's dist dir.

`scripts/build_release_wheel.sh` builds a wheel from a staged copy of
`packages/python` with the e2etest fault-injection module and its config
removed. This script verifies the *artifacts that will actually ship* — every
`port-*` archive Vite copies into `packages/data-collector/dist` (the wheel,
and any sdist tarball), not just the staged build that produced the wheel.
It is release.sh's last check before zipping; see ADR-0004 for the
release-wheel boundary this enforces.

Two archive types are in scope, because both can end up in `dist/` and both
get zipped by `release.sh`:

* The wheel (`port-*.whl`) — exactly one is required. It gets the full
  check: the selected platform's own module/config must be present (so the
  check can't pass vacuously against an empty or broken wheel) and no member
  path may reference e2etest.
* Any sdist tarball (`port-*.tar.gz`) — zero or more. A stale sdist
  (`port-0.0.0.tar.gz`) used to be tracked in the data collector's public/
  directory and shipped in every release zip alongside the wheel; it has
  been removed, but nothing structurally prevents another `port-*` archive
  from appearing — so every `port-*` archive found in the dist directory is
  checked. It predated the multi-platform config system and contained neither
  `platforms/` nor `configs/`, but had the same risk: an sdist regenerated
  with current content could carry e2etest past a verifier that only ever
  looked at the wheel. Sdist member names carry a `port-<version>/` prefix
  the wheel doesn't have, so only the absence check applies here — the
  presence/required check is wheel-specific by construction.

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/verify_release_wheel.py <platform> [--dist-dir DIR]

Exits non-zero, with a message on stderr, if:
  * no wheel (or more than one) is found in DIR,
  * any `port-*` archive (wheel or tarball) in DIR contains a member path
    that references e2etest (exact forbidden path, or merely containing the
    substring "e2etest", case-insensitive — catching a renamed config, a
    `e2etest_helpers.py`, a stray `.bak`, or similar drift that an
    exact-path check alone would miss), or
  * the selected platform's own module or config is missing from the wheel.

The checking logic (`check_wheel_names`, `check_archive_for_drift`) takes a
plain list of archive member names so it can be unit-tested against small
synthetic wheels/tarballs without touching the filesystem beyond a tmp_path
fixture — see packages/python/tests/test_verify_release_wheel.py.
