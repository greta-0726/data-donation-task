# Builds the production release wheel from a disposable staged copy of
# packages/python, with the e2etest fault-injection platform and its config
# removed from the copy before the build. The normal development/Playwright
# wheel (`pnpm run build:wheel`, invoked by `pnpm run build:py`) is untouched
# by this script and still includes e2etest — only the release path excludes
# it. See ADR-0004 (release-wheel boundary) and
# ~/notes/e2etest-release-packaging-recommendation.md for the full rationale.
#
# The source checkout is never mutated: everything the exclusion touches is a
# copy in a mktemp directory, removed on exit (including on a failed or
# interrupted build) via the trap below. A signal or crash mid-build can
# leave a stale temp directory behind, never a damaged working tree.
