# The config validator imports the port package's third-party dependencies
# (pandas), so a usable Python environment for packages/python is a
# *precondition* of a release. This script checks for it and stops; it never
# provisions it. Three reasons to probe rather than install:
#
#   * Check, don't provision, is this repo's existing precedent — check-deps.sh
#     reports the missing tool and exits rather than installing it.
#   * dd-script-builder runs the release from a `cp -r` copy of this tree, and
#     its builds are network-free by that repo's ADR-0011. An install here
#     would need the network and would break exactly the case it was added for.
#   * On the production VM the environment belongs to the deployment repo's
#     data-donation-task sync unit, which wipes, re-clones and re-provisions
#     the checkout daily. A release that installed on top of that would be
#     fighting the owner of the state.
#
# Poetry keys its cached environments by project path, so a copied tree has no
# cached environment at all — which is why provisioning creates the venv
# *inside* the tree, at packages/python/.venv, where `cp -r` carries it into
# every build copy. The probe follows the same order: the in-project venv
# first, then whatever environment poetry already associates with this checkout
# (the developer-machine case, where `poetry install` used the global cache).
#
# Nothing here uses `poetry run` — not the probe, not the validation below. In
# a tree with no environment `poetry run` silently creates an empty one as a
# side effect, leaking a directory into the global cache on a machine that was
# only ever asked a question; `poetry env info --executable` only reports — it
# prints nothing and exits non-zero when no environment exists. Resolving the
# interpreter once and then *running it directly* also keeps the probe and the
# validation on the same environment: a second `poetry run` would resolve
# independently, and under `virtualenvs.in-project = false` it would ignore the
# .venv the probe just approved.
#
# The canary is the validator's own import chain (`--help` executes every
# module-level import, then argparse exits 0) rather than a hand-listed
# `import pandas`, so it keeps testing the right thing as dependencies change.
